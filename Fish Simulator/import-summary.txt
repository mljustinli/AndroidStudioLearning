ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
C:\Users\Justin\AndroidStudioProjects\Fish Simulator
                                          -         

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* AndroidManifest.xml
* R.txt
* aapt\
* aapt\AndroidManifest.xml
* proguard.txt
* res\
* res\drawable\
* res\drawable\unityads_background_button_pause.xml
* res\drawable\unityads_icon_play.xml
* res\drawable\unityads_icon_speaker_base.xml
* res\drawable\unityads_icon_speaker_triangle.xml
* res\drawable\unityads_icon_speaker_waves.xml
* res\layout\
* res\layout\unityads_button_audio_toggle.xml
* res\layout\unityads_button_pause.xml
* res\layout\unityads_view_video_paused.xml
* res\layout\unityads_view_video_play.xml
* res\values\
* res\values\values.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => fishSimulator\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => fishSimulator\src\main\assets\
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libmain.so => fishSimulator\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libmain.so
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libmono.so => fishSimulator\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libmono.so
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libunity.so => fishSimulator\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libunity.so
* libs\unity-classes.jar => fishSimulator\libs\unity-classes.jar
* libs\x86\libmain.so => fishSimulator\src\main\jniLibs\x86\libmain.so
* libs\x86\libmono.so => fishSimulator\src\main\jniLibs\x86\libmono.so
* libs\x86\libunity.so => fishSimulator\src\main\jniLibs\x86\libunity.so
* res\ => fishSimulator\src\main\res\
* src\ => fishSimulator\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
